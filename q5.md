## Approach 1:
```
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): 
        res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ')
```
With this method, a function called doubleL(n) is defined, and its input is an integer called n. After that, iterating through the range from 0 to n-1, it constructs an empty list called res. It adds the result of i * 2 to the list res at each iteration. Ultimately, the list res is returned. Outside of the method, a for loop generates a list of doubled values from 0 to 8 (not including 10), calls doubleL(5), iterates through the list, and prints each value with a colon at the end.

## Approach 2:
```
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')
```
This method creates a list of doubled numbers from 0 to 8 (except from 10), directly using a list comprehension. Iterating through the numbers 0 through 4, it computes n * 2 for each value n and appends it to the list. The for loop then iterates across this list, outputting each value after a colon.

## Approach 3:
```
def doubleG(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
    print(i, end=' : ')
```
This method defines a generator function called doubleG(n), whose input is an integer called n. It generates each doubled value from 0 to 8 (except from 10) one at a time using a yield statement. The generated values are iterated over by the for loop outside the function, which prints each value with a colon at the end when it calls doubleG(5).

One generating function is the doubleG function. Using a function like this has the benefit of generating values dynamically, eliminating the need to keep them all in memory at once. As values are generated as needed rather than being stored in memory in advance, this can be more memory-efficient, particularly when working with huge datasets.
